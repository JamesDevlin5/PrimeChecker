# Prime Checker

A program to determine whether a number is (likely) prime or non-prime.

## Definition

Natural Number
: The infinite, countable set `N`, composed of all positive, rational whole numbers. (*1*, *2*, *3*, *4*, ...)

[Prime Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)
: A natural number that is not a product of any two other smaller natural numbers.

## Testing Primality

- [Trial Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division): tests whether *n* is a multiple of any integer between 2 and sqrt(*n*).
- [Miller-Rabin Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test): determines whether a number is *likely* to be prime.
- [AKS Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test): determines whether a number is prime or composite, in polynomial time.
